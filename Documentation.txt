*OPEN THIS TEXT IN THE VSCODE ITSELF*

installation of yolov5, which would be from github repo (not yet)

installation of sort.py, again from git repo (not yet)

try to create a virtual environment for this proj, bcs some imports may have discord with others in other project in the local machine

(What is a VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT?, it is isolated python environment that contains its own dependencies, Interpreter and libraries, commonly used to manage dependencies for different projects w/o causing conflicts) (Why did scrolled horizontally until here!!, you should have typed "Alt + z")

lots of requirement: 
    I have used: 
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

    all you have to do is:
        pip install -r requirements.txt (not yet)

yet after this you may have to install some additional libraries of frameworks if needed, skim the output and terminal to know which one to install

How to create a Virtual Environment:
    python -m venv .venv    (this will create .venv file in cwd)

(If you wonder where to enter the above, the TERMINAL in your cwd, press "ctrl + `" to open terminal in cwd, make sure you have already opened the head.py)
(Same as above, all the commands should be entered in the TERMINAL)

How to activate the Virtual Environment:
    .venv\Scripts\activate  (windows)
    source .venv/bin/activate   (linux/macOS)
    
How to select the Virtual Environment in vscode:
    ctrl + shift + p    (Command Prompt)
    Enter "Python: Select Interpreter"
    Then choose ".venv\Scripts\python" or simply the python version will be visible

install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

install sort:
    git clone https://github.com/abewley/sort.git
    cd sort 
    pip install .
    ("pip install ." may not work, you may get an error like "Directory '.' is not installable. Neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found"), then simply,

    go to file manager, copy or cut the sort.txt from the sort folder (which you have cloned in you working directory)
    and paste outside the sort folder (where head.py exits)

    then, 
        pip install scikit-image    (no need as you've installed the dependencies from requirements.txt)


install yolov5:
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
    cd yolov5
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

    (If you want to verify the installation or want to see what yolov5 can do, look at it like a small demo)

    run:
        python detect.py --source https://ultralytics.com/image/zidane.jpg

    (this will download the ex. image and detect some objects in it, the output image will be saved in "yolov5/runs/detect/exp" from your cwd)


    use this whenever you want to update zolov5:
        git pull    (in the TERMINAL, in the yolov5 folder)
